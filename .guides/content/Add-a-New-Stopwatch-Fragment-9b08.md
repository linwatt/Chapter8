We’re going to add a new stopwatch fragment called *StopwatchFragment.java* that uses a layout called *fragment_stopwatch.xml*. We’re going to base the fragment on the stopwatch activity we created back in Chapter 4.

We already know that activities and fragments behave in similar ways, but we also know that a fragment is a distinct type of object— a fragment is not a subclass of activity. **Is there some way we could rewrite that activity code so that it works like a fragment**?
