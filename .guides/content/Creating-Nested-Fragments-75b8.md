In Chapter 7, you saw how to create fragments, how to include them in activities, and how to connect them together. To do this, we created a list fragment displaying a list of workouts, and a fragment displaying details of a single workout.

It’s not just activities that can contain fragments—fragments can be nested inside other fragments. So that you can see this in action, we’re going to add a stopwatch fragment to our workout detail fragment.
