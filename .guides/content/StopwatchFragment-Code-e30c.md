We’ll add StopwatchFragment to our Workout project so that we can use it in our app. You do this in the same way you did in Chapter 7. Go to File→New...→Fragment→Fragment (Blank). Give the fragment a name of “StopwatchFragment”, a layout name of “fragment_stopwatch”, and untick the options for including fragment factory methods and interface callbacks.
